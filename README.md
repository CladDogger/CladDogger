Good day! i am CladDogger, I am a student at a technological data school studying to become a IT-Supporter💻 and Data Technichian⚙.
I do things like drawing🖌 and animation✏, which is why  I got github so I could work with some friends on some projects. 
I also do other things in my free time, I like to play games and I am into the custom mechanical keyboard market.

I know a little bit of coding, though mainly on swift since that is what my education is using. 
In my future I wanna use either my animation, tech or keyboard knowledge to get a job.
